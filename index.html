        Appearance:
        Tippy is an angora rabbit. She is female, although her body is inhabited by the soul and conscience of Chino's grandfather.
        
        Personality:
        Tippy acts as a little companion for Chino and her friends. She has the personality of Chino's grandfather and his memories, meaning he's kept skills he had when he was alive, unfortunately he's only retained abilities, his new rabbit-vessel can handle, like giving life advice at needed moments. Only Chino and her father know he is able to talk (at the end of the season 1). However, in the 2nd season, Cocoa and Chiya somehow knew that he could talk and asked him to "read their coffee fortunes". Despite being most likely really old, Tippy acts far more childish compared to his son.
